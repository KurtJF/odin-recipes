    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Serving Size: 20 servings</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pounds fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a wide bowl, crush strawberries in batches until you have 4 cups of
        mashed berry.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a heavy bottomed saucepan, mix together the strawberries, sugar, and
        lemon juice. Stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Increase
        heat to high, and bring the mixture to a full rolling boil. Boil,
        stirring often, until the mixture reaches 220 degrees F (105 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to hot sterile jars, leaving 1/4 to 1/2 inch headspace, and
        seal. Process in a water bath. If the jam is going to be eaten right
        away, don't bother with processing, and just refrigerate.
      </li>
    </ol>
